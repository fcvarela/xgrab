				<h1>Cursor is duplicated if screen is zoomed</h1>

            <br/>
			<p>xGrab uses a blazing fast capture method which is implemented in Mac OS X by OpenGL and QuickTime. This method, however, does not provide images with cursors. xGrab circumvents this shortcoming by composing a cursor image on top of the capture buffer.<br>
                <br>
                But if a user chooses to zoom in on the screen using ctrl-mouse wheel, then the capture buffer does include a cursor. xGrab is not aware of this not can it be because there are no notifications of current zoom level changes in Mac OS X. Because of this, xGrab always draws a cursor image regardless of whether the capture buffer already includes one.<br>
                <br>
                Apple is aware of this problem and as soon as it is addressed, xGrab will be updated to correct the issue.

			<div summary="How to solve cursor duplication" id="taskbox">
				<p>
					<strong>To solve this problem do one of the following:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Refrain from zooming in while capturing</li>
						<li>If you feel the need to increase GUI relative appearance, consider reducing your screen resolution instead</li>
					</ul>
