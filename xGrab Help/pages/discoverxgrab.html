			<p>xGrab records your screen actions into a movie. It compresses the movie as it goes so there's need to post-process the captured frames. This means that as soon as you stop recording, your movie is ready to play.<br>
<br>
xGrab captures your entire screen. That's it. No bells no whistles. But its list of features will expand over time. Later in the development cycle, you'll be able to select a capture region, crop or scale the captured video to a smaller size, just like most other thrice as expensive capture applications.<br>
<br>
If you purchase now at a special 12 â‚¬ price, you'll get free updates with lots of new features until the next major release (that's 2.0) at which point, you'll still be able to upgrade at a special price.</p>
